# MS-SMART
MS-SMART facilitated the discovery of new berberines from plants belonging to various families and genera. Diagnostic ions were first extracted and validated using available reference alkaloid data. Subsequently, berberine-type compounds were automatically filtered from raw liquid chromatography tandem high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) data. Finally, the structures of the target components were recommended using the building blocks derived from berberines report-ed in different plants.

This repository provide MS/MS spectra of five plant extract.
